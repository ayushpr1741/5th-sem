        <h1>Nature's Bounty</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
            <p>Untouched nature in all its splendour is what Uttarakhand offers visitors. The state has been blessed with gorgeous natural beauty. The fact that almost 45.43 per cent of its geographical area has a dense forest cover, makes it all the more remarkable. The state is host to the mighty Himalayas, which guarantee a rich growth of flora and fauna, a pleasant climate and a peaceful and serene environment. The many glaciers here are sources of some of the major rivers of India, including the Ganga and the Yamuna. Snow-covered mountain peaks, like Nanda Devi, Badrinath, and Kamet, offer stunning views, while oak, rhododendron, deodar, and pine forests leave one in awe.

                    <p>Chandrashilla, meaning "moon rock" in Hindi, is a peak nestled in the Garhwal Himalayas, Uttarakhand. Standing at around 4,000 meters (13,123 ft), it offers breathtaking views of the surrounding peaks, including the majestic Nanda Devi. While not as high as some nearby giants, Chandrashilla's spiritual significance and scenic beauty make it a popular trekking destination</p>

                    <p>Shrouded in some mystery, Swargarohini (Sanskrit for "heaven-ascent") could be a Himalayan peak or a symbolic reference.  Located roughly 100 km northwest of Badrinath, it might be the same as Mandara peak mentioned in the Mahabharata.  Its challenging terrain makes it a potential climber's goal, but it also holds spiritual significance, possibly a gateway to the heavens in mythology.</p>

                    <p>Trisul is a group of three Himalayan mountain peaks of western Kumaun, Uttarakhand, with the highest (Trisul I) reaching 7120m. The three peaks resemble a trident - in Sanskrit, Trishula, trident, is the weapon of Shiva. The Trishul group forms the southwest corner of the ring of peaks enclosing the Nanda Devi Sanctuary, about 15 kilometres (9 mi) west-southwest of Nanda Devi itself. The main peak, Trisul I, was the first peak over 7,000 m (22,970 ft) to have ever been climbed, in 1907.</p>
